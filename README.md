# SpectraClash

SpectraClash is an innovative tool for generating sports highlights using audio processing techniques. It extracts audio from video content, processes it, and stitches together segments where the audio level is high. These high audio levels typically indicate moments of excitement, such as cheering from the crowd or an increase in the commentator's voice, which are often highlight-worthy moments in sports events.
